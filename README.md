As the **Lead Software Engineer** in **Blue Sky Solar Racing** (2023 - present), a student-run solar car engineering design team, I led the development of the software component of the team's electrical system. In the process, we developed various open-source programs and libraries that can be used by others.

One of my primary interests is poker. I served as the **President** of **University of Toronto Poker Club** (2020 - 2023) and **Director** of **University of Toronto Computer Poker Research Group** (2023 - present), I exclusively developed or led the development of various open-source software projects related to poker, some of which have established widespread use in the computer poker community as the de-facto software solution. Their usages range from poker game simulation, hand evaluation, table management, to tournament management. Our online poker game platform LibrePoker, is used by the **University of Toronto Poker Club** to host various online events.

**Poker**

- [PokerKit](https://github.com/uoftcprg/pokerkit): [IEEE ToG] An open-source Python library for poker simulations and hand evaluations
- [Cardroom](https://github.com/uoftcprg/cardroom): Poker tournament and table management library
- [LibrePoker](https://github.com/uoftcprg/librepoker): The web application for LibrePoker, offering a secure, minimalist, and user-friendly online poker game experience

**AI**

- [PadChannel](https://github.com/AussieSeaweed/pad-channel): Encoding padding statuses as an input channel for enhanced performance in convolutional neural networks

**Miscellaneous**

- [RITC](https://github.com/AussieSeaweed/ritc): A Python library for interacting with the Rotman Interactive Trader Market Simulator Client Application
